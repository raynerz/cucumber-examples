# Cucumber Examples

This repository contains a number of practice examples for learning Cucumber. 

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a BDD (Behavior Driven Development) tool to facilitate specifying an application's
behavior by way of examples.  The examples are then used as:

- executable specifications
- living documentation
- automated acceptance tests
